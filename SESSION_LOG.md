# Omnipath v2: Session Log

**Purpose**: To maintain a running log of development sessions, decisions made, and the state of the system. This file serves as the primary source of truth for project continuity, ensuring that each session can build directly on the last without losing context.

**Format**: Each session is a level-2 markdown header (`##`) with the date, followed by a summary of work completed, key decisions, and the state of the system at the end of the session.

## 2026-07-31: Canonical Recovery and Economy-Ledger Pivot Checkpoint

* **Branch**: `recovery/v7.1.5-canonical`
* **Checkpoint commit**: `3e1066f` (`feat(economy): add migration recovery tooling`)
* **Completed**: Canonical recovery plus atomic economy-ledger Commits 1–4:
  exact contracts, atomic Redis mutation, append-only PostgreSQL archival,
  signed legacy inventory, reconciliation, fenced locks, and guarded recovery.
* **Validation**: 1,138 passed, 2 skipped locally; formatting, lint, mypy,
  Bandit, Alembic downgrade/upgrade, Docker build, and image scan passed.
  GitHub Actions run `30642709117` is green for the exact checkpoint SHA.
* **Safety state**: Runtime callers remain on the legacy marketplace. No
  production cutover, legacy deletion, retention trimming, or repository
  promotion has occurred.
* **Decision**: Commit 5 caller migration is deferred. The next behavioral
  change must follow a separately defined and approved project pivot.

## 2026-03-02: Phases 1-5 Retrospective Log

This initial entry is a retroactive summary of the work completed to bring the system to the v6.4 state, based on the git commit history.

### Phase 1: The Persistent Agent (v6.0)

*   **Commit**: `bba14dd`
*   **Summary**: Implemented the foundational `PersistentAgent` class, giving agents a unique ID, a home directory in the sandbox, and the ability to maintain state across sessions. This was the first step in moving from stateless tools to stateful, autonomous entities. A key post-deploy fix (`cb0b3e6`) was required to address two bugs found during the initial proof mission, demonstrating the importance of real-world testing.

### Phase 2: The Scheduled Agent (v6.1)

*   **Commit**: `77bfd45`
*   **Summary**: Introduced the `SchedulerService` and the `schedule` tool, allowing agents to schedule future tasks using cron expressions or intervals. This gave the system the dimension of time, enabling long-running autonomous operations, recurring tasks, and delayed execution. A critical fix (`304450e`) was needed to correct the Alembic migration chain, reinforcing the need for careful database schema management.

### Phase 3: The Self-Marketing Agent (v6.2)

*   **Commit**: `cb8ef2b`
*   **Summary**: The first true multi-agent, multi-tool workflow. This phase implemented an agent capable of autonomously marketing itself on social media. It used the `search` tool to find relevant discussions, the `generate` tool to create content, and integrated with Reddit and Twitter APIs (via the `RedditTool` and `TwitterTool`) to post the content. This was the first demonstration of the system's ability to interact with the external world in a meaningful way.

### Phase 4: The Coordinating Agent (v6.3)

*   **Commit**: `3620c2c`
*   **Summary**: This was a major architectural leap. The `WorkforceCoordinator` was introduced, a meta-agent capable of decomposing a high-level goal into a sequence of sub-missions and assigning each to a specialized agent (Researcher, Analyst, Writer, Poster). It introduced the concepts of `WorkforcePlan` and `SubMission`, transforming the system from a collection of individual agents into a coordinated, intelligent workforce. This laid the groundwork for all future complex orchestration.

### Phase 5: The Revenue Agent (v6.4)

*   **Commit**: `90dd360`
*   **Summary**: The culmination of all previous phases. The `RevenueAgent` was built on top of the `WorkforceCoordinator` to automate the entire B2B sales pipeline. It discovers leads, qualifies them using an Analyst agent, generates proposals with a Writer agent, and can optionally send outreach. This phase also introduced the `DealClosingSaga` for robust, multi-step transaction management and a full suite of 12 API endpoints for managing the revenue pipeline. This represents the most complex and business-critical capability of the system to date.

## 2026-03-03: Phase 6 (Session Start)

*   **Objective**: Define and execute Phase 6: The Self-Auditing Workforce (v6.5).
*   **State at Start**: All 624 tests are passing after fixing 5 pre-existing test failures related to mock contamination and incorrect test setups. The codebase is stable and ready for the next phase of development.
*   **Plan**:
    1.  ~~Audit current agent capabilities and identify real gaps.~~ (Complete)
    2.  ~~Design the Phase 6 proof missions and define acceptance criteria.~~ (Complete)
    3.  ~~Fix the 5 existing test failures.~~ (Complete)
    4.  **Implement `SESSION_LOG.md` and update `STRATEGIC_ROADMAP.md`.** (In Progress)
    5.  Build the Phase 6 proof mission runner and gap-detection harness.
    6.  Commit, push, and deliver Phase 6 summary.
