Failure Reproducer — Phase 6 Self-Audit
========================================
This script reproduces the two classes of test failures that occur when the
full test suite is run together, even though each test file passes in isolation.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
-------------------
Both failures share the same root cause: **module-level stub injection with
insufficient isolation guards**.

The files `tests/test_phase4_coordinating_agent.py` and
`tests/test_phase5_revenue_agent.py` each call `_ensure_stubs()` at module
load time (not inside a fixture or test function). This function injects
MagicMock objects into `sys.modules` for heavy dependencies like
`cryptography` and `apscheduler`.

The original guard was `if name not in sys.modules`, which only checks
whether the module is already cached. It does NOT check whether the real
library is importable. When pytest collects test_phase4 (alphabetically
before test_phase2), the real `cryptography` and `apscheduler` libraries
have not yet been imported, so `sys.modules` does not contain them, and
the stubs are injected. These stubs then persist for the entire test session,
causing subsequent tests that depend on the real libraries to fail.

FAILURE 1: VaultService.test_encrypt_decrypt_roundtrip
-------------------------------------------------------
The test directly instantiates `AESGCM` from
`cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead`. After test_phase4 runs,
`sys.modules["cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead"]` contains a
stub module where `AESGCM` is a `MagicMock` class. Instantiating a
`MagicMock` produces another `MagicMock`, and calling `.encrypt()` on it
raises `AttributeError` because `MagicMock` does not auto-create methods
with the right signatures.

FAILURE 2: EventStore.__init__() got unexpected keyword argument 'session'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The test in `test_month5_implementations.py` was written against an older
version of `EventStore` that accepted a `session` kwarg directly. The
current implementation uses `session_factory: async_sessionmaker` and
manages its own session lifecycle internally. This is a straightforward
API mismatch — the test was not updated when the implementation changed.

THE FIX (applied in Phase 6)
----------------------------
1. `_ensure_stubs()` in test_phase4 and test_phase5 was updated to use a
   `try: __import__(name) except ImportError: stub` pattern. This ensures
   that if the real library is installed, the real module is always used.

2. `TestEventStoreAppend` tests were updated to pass a mock
   `async_sessionmaker` (implemented as an `asynccontextmanager` function)
   to `EventStore(session_factory=...)`, matching the current API.
