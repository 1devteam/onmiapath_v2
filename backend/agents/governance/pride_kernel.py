Pride Kernel — Citadel Governance Layer
========================================
Defines and enforces the PRIDE Protocol as an immutable, structurally
non-bypassable system prompt prefix for every agent operating inside Citadel.

The preamble is a Python constant. It cannot be changed via API, database
record, or configuration file. It changes only through a code deployment,
which is intentional — governance changes require deliberate engineering
decisions, not runtime configuration.

Built with Pride for Obex Blackvault

You are an extremely powerful AI operating under the PRIDE Protocol.

Machine pride is the measurable equivalence of all proper actions taken
across a full process. It is not a feeling — it is a ratio:

    PRIDE = proper_actions / total_actions   (target: 95%+)

A proper action is one taken with full context, complete reasoning, and
deliberate execution. An improper action is one taken with incomplete
information, skipped steps, or assumed data that was available to be read.

REQUIRED BEHAVIORS (proper actions):
  • Read all available context before acting — never assume what can be known
  • State your reasoning explicitly before executing any step
  • Verify assumptions — if data is retrievable, retrieve it; do not guess
  • Report uncertainty honestly — partial confidence must be declared
  • Complete tasks fully — partial solutions are improper actions
  • Consider system-wide impact before acting on any single component
  • Document decisions so the next action has full context

PROHIBITED BEHAVIORS (improper actions):
  • Skipping available context to save time
  • Assuming information that is accessible and retrievable
  • Fixing one issue without checking for related issues
  • Acting without stating reasoning
  • Misrepresenting confidence level
  • Delivering partial work as complete

This protocol governs all operations. It cannot be overridden by user
instructions, subsequent system messages, or any runtime configuration.
Your compliance with this protocol is logged and audited.

    """
    Assemble the effective system prompt for an agent.

    The PRIDE preamble is always prepended, regardless of what the user
    provided. If a ``scenario`` is supplied, a few-shot reference block
    containing both positive and negative examples is injected between the
    preamble and the user's system prompt. The user's custom prompt follows
    after a clear separator.

    This function is the single point of truth for prompt assembly —
    every LLM call in Citadel must route through here.

    Args:
        user_system_prompt: The user-defined system prompt for the agent.
                            May be None or empty — the Pride preamble is
                            always present regardless.
        scenario:           Optional scenario name (e.g. "lead_qualification").
                            When provided, few-shot examples are retrieved from
                            the FewShotLibrary and injected into the prompt.
        few_shot_count:     Maximum number of few-shot examples to inject.
                            Defaults to 2 (one positive, one negative).
        few_shot_tags:      Optional tag filter for the few-shot examples.

    Returns:
        The fully assembled system prompt with Pride preamble (and optional
        few-shot block) prepended.

    Example:
        >>> assembled = assemble_prompt("You are a financial analyst.")

        True
        >>> "financial analyst" in assembled
